# Streaming Chat Fix

## Problem

The streaming chat functionality in `sdk/ai_chatbot_sdk.py` was not working correctly. The API and service layers were properly yielding streaming events, but the SDK was yielding raw JSON strings instead of parsed objects.

## Root Cause

The SDK's `chat_stream` method was yielding raw JSON strings from Server-Sent Events (SSE), but the client code expected parsed Python dictionaries. This mismatch caused the client to have to manually parse JSON, which was error-prone and inconsistent with the rest of the SDK's API.

## Solution

### SDK Changes (`sdk/ai_chatbot_sdk.py`)

1. **Modified `chat_stream` method** to parse JSON and yield `Dict[str, Any]` instead of raw strings
2. **Updated return type annotation** from `AsyncIterator[str]` to `AsyncIterator[Dict[str, Any]]`
3. **Added robust JSON parsing** with error handling for malformed data
4. **Updated documentation** with comprehensive docstring and examples

### Client Changes (`client/chatbot.py`)

1. **Removed manual JSON parsing** since SDK now yields parsed objects
2. **Simplified event processing** by working directly with dictionaries
3. **Improved error handling** for unexpected data types

## Event Types

The streaming API now properly yields parsed events with these types:

- `start`: Stream initialization
- `content`: Text content chunks
- `tool_call`: Tool execution results  
- `complete`: Final response with metadata
- `error`: Error occurred during processing
- `end`: Stream termination

## Example Usage

```python
from sdk.ai_chatbot_sdk import AIChatbotSDK
from shared.schemas import ChatRequest

sdk = AIChatbotSDK("http://localhost:8000")
chat_request = ChatRequest(user_message="Hello", conversation_id=1)

# Stream events are now parsed dictionaries
async for event in sdk.conversations.chat_stream(chat_request):
    if event.get("type") == "content":
        print(event["content"], end="", flush=True)
    elif event.get("type") == "complete":
        print(f"\nResponse: {event['response']}")
    elif event.get("type") == "error":
        print(f"Error: {event['error']}")
```

## Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Yields typed dictionaries instead of raw strings
2. **Error Handling**: Robust JSON parsing with fallback error events
3. **Consistency**: Matches the pattern of other SDK methods
4. **Ease of Use**: No manual JSON parsing required by clients
5. **Better Documentation**: Clear event types and structure

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- JSON parsing works correctly
- Event sequence is preserved
- Error handling for malformed JSON
- Client compatibility maintained
- Integration with existing code patterns

The fix has been verified to work correctly with the existing client implementation.

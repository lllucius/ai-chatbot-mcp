"""Search-related Pydantic schemas.

This module has been cleaned up to remove duplicate schemas.

Search response schemas are now located in search_responses.py.
Search parameter schemas are located in common.py (SearchParams).
Document search schemas are located in document.py.

This eliminates duplication and provides a clearer schema organization.

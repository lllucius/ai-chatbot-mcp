## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Tool Integration Compatibility**
   - Risk: MCP tool calling may break with LangChain agents
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing of tool execution flows
   - Fallback: Maintain original tool calling implementation

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Risk: LangChain/LlamaIndex overhead may slow responses
   - Mitigation: Continuous performance monitoring and optimization
   - Fallback: Feature flags to disable new implementations

3. **Vector Store Migration**
   - Risk: Data loss or corruption during vector store changes
   - Mitigation: Full database backups before changes
   - Fallback: Restore from backup and use original search

4. **Memory Usage with LlamaIndex**
   - Risk: Large document processing may cause memory issues
   - Mitigation: Gradual rollout with monitoring
   - Fallback: Reduce document batch sizes or disable features

### Monitoring Strategy

#### Key Metrics to Track
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates by service
- Memory usage patterns
- Token consumption rates
- Search quality metrics
- User satisfaction scores

#### Alerting Thresholds
- Response time > 2x baseline
- Error rate > 1%
- Memory usage > 80%
- Search quality score < 0.8

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase Rollout Plan

1. **Internal Testing (Weeks 1-12)**
   - Development environment only
   - Feature flags disabled in production

2. **Staging Validation (Weeks 13-14)**
   - Enable features in staging environment
   - Run full test suite
   - Performance validation

3. **Limited Production Rollout (Weeks 15-16)**
   - Enable for 10% of users
   - Monitor key metrics
   - Gradual increase to 50%

4. **Full Production Rollout (Weeks 17-18)**
   - Enable for all users
   - Monitor for 1 week
   - Remove feature flags

### Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Disable features via environment variables
export USE_LANGCHAIN=false
export USE_LLAMAINDEX=false
# Restart services
kubectl rollout restart deployment/api-server
```

#### Database Rollback (< 30 minutes)
```bash
# Restore from backup if schema changes cause issues
pg_restore --clean --if-exists -d chatbot_db backup_pre_migration.sql
```

#### Full System Rollback (< 2 hours)
```bash
# Deploy previous version
git checkout previous-stable-tag
docker build -t ai-chatbot:rollback .
kubectl set image deployment/api-server api=ai-chatbot:rollback
```
